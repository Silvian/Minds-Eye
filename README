Ok so this will be a project writen in python, the GUI will be built using GTK+
and in all fairness just be aimed at Ubuntu.

The features I want it to have are:
	A slick way to upload files to a user's home directory
	A feed from Facebook
	A feed from Twitter (Hopefully someone will start tweeting)
	Maybe a way to connect to IRC on minds.. very doubtful about that
	Desktop Notifications for the feeds would be nice

Right now I would be happy to get stuff pulled from FB and Twitter and not have
the abbility to upload for a while.
